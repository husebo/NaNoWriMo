## The Removal

- Lukasz removes the bug from Wint's head
- He puts it under analysis
- Finds out he was the tracker all along
- He didn't know, names aren't transmitted, they don't have brain symbols
- The way the whole system works isn't the same way language at large works -- it's not about specific words or sounds. It's concepts.
- In Wint's brain, Ada held the concept of Love, Fear, Regret (or sth?)
