# The Collective

The purpose of the collective is to develop technology that will survive the cataclysmic extinction event. Fourth World Tech. Most of the members fantasise about return to the state of nature..

The thing that binds them together is the belief that no matter how the society develops, "good" people must have AI, and "bad" people must not have AI.

The people currently developing AI are the bad people, because they have no inherent morality, they care about profit.

In the future, the delimitation won't be the the borders of the Westphalian nation state system -- it will be companies. Or, the collective wants to ensure, cooperatives of human.

They don't need resources. They have a lot of money from bitcoin -- they've completely lost faith in the cause, so they're selling off in order to invest into their endgame: a good, socialist AI.
