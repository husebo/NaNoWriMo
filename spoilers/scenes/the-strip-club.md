## Chapter 8

- There's a gunfight. They escape via the back elevator
- The lift takes them to a service tunnel
- They walk for a very long time
- They come up. Wint looks around. They're on an island. It's a old military defense base.
- That's where Ada's group is based.

- Eventually they need to move from the base. Maybe they detect a drone.
- Fuck, they've been discovered!
- How could that be? The tunnel means nobody could have followed them in.
- They go to a safe house
- The Bug Hunt happens
