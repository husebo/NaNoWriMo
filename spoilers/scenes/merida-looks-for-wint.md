- She finds the laptop? Same password? Of course.
- The search is there. Wallet.dat.

- Finds the article, pieces together what has happened -- someone has broken in
- Where then?
  - Outside, someone is trying to break in
  - ...
  - They have keys
  - It's the northerner, coming to return the suitcase.
  - Awkward scene -- who are you? Who are YOU?
  - He's wearing Wint's jacket?
    - What fun can we have with the misunderstanding?
  - Now we have Merida, and Northerner together. What can we do with that? Two worlds have collided.
    - Maybe it's this pair that can use The Platform somehow
    - Maybe he clicks through to some part of it that Merida never knew about

## Merida goes sleuthing

- She can use Laura, with whom they have an adversarial romance going on, to get to Zee.
