## The Community

This is maybe a different book?

Write a story in which all the protagonists are rich white people living in a gated community. They are afraid of "the other" other there -- the hordes, the savages.

The rich people go out there to defend themselves, killing a whole bunch of them?

Until it turns out this is just a modern-day SF and the people out there are the regular everyday people -- some of them angry at the rich, but not in any way savage.
